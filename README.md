# discordjs-swiftpay-example
This is my first Discord bot, and I put almost no work into it. I just needed to have it done right now.

# Setup
You will need node installed
https://nodejs.org/en/

Open the project in your preferred IDE after that, and then install the following dependencies.
(Type the following in your terminal terminal)
```
npm i dotenv
npm i discord.js
npm i axios
```

Enter your Bot Token and Swift API key in the .env file (your environment file) after that.
Then do npm start (or node index)
